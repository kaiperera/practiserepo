#### Communication
### Prerequisites
```{r PREREQUISITES}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
library(patchwork)
```

### Labels
When turning exploratory graphic to expository graphic, need good labels
```{r LABELS}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Car type",
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because of their light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
```
title needs to summarise main finding rather than describing what plot is
if more text needed, 2 other usfeul labels:
```
subtitle = additional detail in smaller font beneath title
caption = adds text at bottom right of plot - used to describe source of data
```
can use labs to replace axis and legend titles - good idea to replace short variable names with more detailed descriptions and to include units
possible to use mathematical equation instead of text strings - switch "" to quote() 
```{r MATHS INSTEAD OF TEXT STRING}
df <- tibble(
  x = 1:10,
  y = cumsum(x^2)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = quote(x[i]),
    y = quote(sum(x[i] ^ 2, i == 1, n))
  )
```

## Exercises
1. Create one plot on the fuel economy data with customized title, subtitle, caption, x, y, and color labels.
```{r 1}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = year)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Fuel economy decreases with engine size",
       subtitle = "colour denotes year of manufacture",
       x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
       y = "Highway Fuel Economy (mpg)",
       caption = "mpg dataframe on R")
```

2. Recreate the following plot using the fuel economy data. Note that both the colors and shapes of points vary by type of drive train.
```{r 2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv, shape = drv)) +
  labs (
    x = "City MPG",
    y = "Highway MPG",
    colour = "Type of drive train",
    shape = "Type of drive train"
  )
```

### Annotations
also useful to label individual/ groups of observations :
```
geom_text - similar to geo_point BUT has additional aesthetic: label - possible to add textual labels to plots
```
2 possible label sources:

1. tibble provides labels
following plot oulls out cars w highest engine size in each drive type and save their info as new df

```{r TIBBLE PROVIDES LABELS- DF CREATION}
label_info <- mpg |>
  group_by(drv) |>
  arrange(desc(displ)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1) |>
  mutate(
    drive_type = case_when(
      drv == "f" ~ "front-wheel drive",
      drv == "r" ~ "rear-wheel drive",
      drv == "4" ~ "4-wheel drive"
    )
  ) |>
  select(displ, hwy, drv, drive_type)
```
use this new df to directly label 3 groups to replace legend with labels placed directly onto plot
using fontface and size arguments - customise look of text labels - larger than res of text on plot and bolded
(theme(legend.position = "none")) turns off all legends
```{r TIBBLE PROVIDES LABELS - PLOT}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_text(
    data = label_info, 
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold", size = 5, hjust = "right", vjust = "bottom"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
hjust = horizontal justification
vjust = vertical justification 
control label alignments

BUT annoated plot made above hard to read as labels overlap with each other/ points
can use geom_label_repel from ggrepel to address both issues - automatically adjusts labels so they don't overlap:
```{r LABEL REPEL}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = label_info, 
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold", size = 2, nudge_y = 5
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
can also use same idea to highlight certain points on plot with geom_text_repel from ggrepel
another useful technique = added second layer of large hollow points to further highlight labelled points:
```{r GEOM TEXT REPEL}
potential_outliers <- mpg |> 
  filter(hwy > 40 | (hwy > 20 & displ > 5)) 


  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = potential_outliers, aes(label = model)) +
  geom_point(
    data = potential_outliers,
    colour = "red", size = 3, shape = "circle open")
```
other geoms help with plot annotating:
```
geom_hline/ geom_vline = add reference lines - usually thhick (linewidth = 2) and white - drawn underneath primary data layer for ease

geom_rect = draw rectangle around points of interest - boundaries of rectangle defined by aesthetics xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax 
ALT: ggforce package - geom_mark_hull = allows annotation of subsets of points with hulls

geom_segment = with arrow argument to draw attention to point with an arrow - use aesthetics x and y to define starting location - xend and yend define end of location
```

annotate function- geoms generally useful for highlighting subset of data vs annotate() = useful for adding one or few annotation elements to a plot
to demonstrate, add text to plot- text long so using stringr::str_wrap() to automatically add line breaks to it given the number of characters wanted per line:
```{r ANNOTATE()}
trend_text <- "Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy" |> 
  str_wrap(width = 30)

trend_text
```
Then add 2 layers of annotation- 1 w label geom and other with segment geom
x and y aesthetics in both define where annotations shoudl start, and xend and yend aesthetics in segment annotation define end location of the segment- also styled as an arrow
```{r 2 ANNOTATION LAYERS}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate(
    geom = "label", x = 3.5, y = 38,
    label = trend_text, 
    hjust = "left",  colour = "red"
     ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "segment", 
    x = 3, y = 35, xend = 5, yend = 25, colour = "red", 
    arrow = arrow(type = "closed")
  )
```

## Exercises
1. Use geom_text() with infinite positions to place text at the four corners of the plot
```{r 1}
# Create the plot with text at the four corners
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = Inf, label = "Top Right"), 
            hjust = 1, vjust = 1, nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = 0.5) +  # Adjust top-right corner label
  geom_text(aes(x = -Inf, y = Inf, label = "Top Left"), 
            hjust = 0, vjust = 1, nudge_x = -0.5, nudge_y = 0.5) +  # Adjust top-left corner label
  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = -Inf, label = "Bottom Right"), 
            hjust = 1, vjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = -0.5) + # Adjust bottom-right corner label
  geom_text(aes(x = -Inf, y = -Inf, label = "Bottom Left"), 
            hjust = 0, vjust = 0, nudge_x = -0.5, nudge_y = -0.5) +  # Adjust bottom-left corner label
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +  # Remove legend for clarity
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")  # Disable clipping to allow text outside plot area

```

2. Use annotate() to add a point geom in the middle of your last plot without having to create a tibble. Customize the shape, size, or color of the point.
```{r 2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = Inf, label = "Top Right"), 
            hjust = 1, vjust = 1, nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = 0.5) +  
  geom_text(aes(x = -Inf, y = Inf, label = "Top Left"), 
            hjust = 0, vjust = 1, nudge_x = -0.5, nudge_y = 0.5) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = Inf, y = -Inf, label = "Bottom Right"), 
            hjust = 1, vjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = -0.5) +  
  geom_text(aes(x = -Inf, y = -Inf, label = "Bottom Left"), 
            hjust = 0, vjust = 0, nudge_x = -0.5, nudge_y = -0.5) +   
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +  
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")  +
  annotate(
    geom = "point", x = median(mpg$displ), y = median(mpg$displ), 
    colour = "red", size = 4, shape = 17
  )
```

3. How do labels with geom_text() interact with faceting? How can you add a label to a single facet? How can you put a different label in each facet? (Hint: Think about the dataset that is being passed to geom_text().)
```{r 3}
# Adding label to single facet
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~drv) + 
  geom_text(
  data = subset(mpg, drv == "4"),
  aes(x = 5, y = 30, label = "4- wheel drive"), 
  colour = "blue", size = 5, hjust = 1
) +
  geom_text(
    data = subset(mpg, drv == "f"),
    aes(x = 5, y= 30, label = "front wheel drive"), 
    colour = "red", size = 5, 
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = subset(mpg, drv == "r"),
    aes(x = 5, y= 30, label ="rear wheel drive"), 
    colour = "green", size = 5, 
  )




```

4.What arguments to geom_label() control the appearance of the background box?

fill = controls background colour of label
colour = controls border colour
label.padding = controls padding around text in label- adds space between text and border
label. r = Controls the radius of the corners of the label box
label.size = controls border thickness in mm
label.fontface = controls font
label.colour = controls text colour

5. What are the four arguments to arrow()? How do they work? Create a series of plots that demonstrate the most important options

a) type = controls arrowhead style- open(default), closed and both - last adds arrowhead to both ends
b) length = controls size- eg)unit(0.25, "inches") - default
c) angle = 15 - default
d) ends = which end of the line should have arrows - last (default), first, both
```{r 5a }
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = displ, yend = hwy),
    arrow = arrow(type = "open"),
    color = "blue"
  )
```
```{r 5b}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = displ, yend = hwy),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "inches")),
    color = "blue"
  )
```
```{r 5c}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = displ, yend = hwy),
    arrow = arrow(angle = 5),
    color = "blue"
  )
```
```{r 5d}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = displ, yend = hwy),
    arrow = arrow(ends = "last"),
    color = "blue"
  )
```
```{r 5 ALL}
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = displ + 1, yend = hwy + 5), 
    arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(0.3, "inches"), angle = 25, ends = "both"),
    color = "blue"
  )

```

### Scales
## Default Scales
ggplot automatically adds scales:
```{r DEFAULT SCALES}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))
```
automatic defaults behind scenes:
```{r WHAT THE DEFAULTS ARE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_color_discrete()
```
naming scheme = scale_ aesthetic_ name of scale
default scales names according to type of variable align with eg) continuous
scale_x_continuous = puts numeric values from displ on continuous number line on x axis
scale_colour_discrete = chooses colour for each class of car etc
may want to override defaults for 2 reasons:
```
1. tweak parameters of default scale  - change axes breaks / key labels on legends
2. replace scale completely - use completely different algorithm - usually can do better than default as you know your data
```

## Axis ticks and Legend Keys
axes + legends = guides - axis= x and y aesthetics, legend = everything else
2 main arguments affecting appearance of ticks on axes / keys on legend : breaks and labels
breaks = controls tick position / values associated w keys
labels = controls text label associated with each tick / key
most common use of breaks is to override default:
```{r BREAKS TO OVERRIDE DEFAULT}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 40, by = 5)) 
```
can use labels in same way (character vector same length as breaks) BUT can also set to NULL to suppress labels completely
useful for maps  / publishing plots where can't share absolute numbers
can also use breaks and labels to control legend appearance
for discrete scales of categorical variables, labels can be named list of existing level names and desired labels for them:
```{r DISCRETE LABELS}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("4" = "4-wheel", "f" = "front", "r" = "rear"))
```
Labels argument + labelling functions from scales package useful for formatting numbers as currency/percent etc.
left plot = default labelling w label_dollar() - adds $ + thousand separator commas
right plot = adds more customisation by dividing dollar values by 1000 + adding suffix K + adds custom breaks - breaks is in OG scale of data
```{r $ EXAMPLE}
# Left
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())

# Right
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = label_dollar(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "K"), 
    breaks = seq(1000, 19000, by = 6000)
  )
```
```{r LABEL_PERCENT}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage", labels = label_percent())
```
Breaks can also be used w relatively few data points + want to highlight exactly where obs occur 
eg) plot showing when each US president began and ended their term:
```{r BREAKS - FEW DATA POINTS AND HIGHLIGHTED OBS}
presidential |>
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = start, y = id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_x_date(name = NULL, breaks = presidential$start, date_labels = "'%y")
```
used start variables for as vector w presidential$start - can't do aesthetic mapping for this argument 
specs of breaks and labels for date / datetime scales different
```
1. date_labels = format spec same as parse_datetime()
2. date_breaks = takes string like "2 days"
```

## Legend Layout
most often use breaks and labels to tweak axes - both work for legends but better options
to control overall legend position - need to use theme()- control non-data parts of plot
theme legend.position controls where legend is drawn:
```{r LEGEND. POSITION}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))

base + theme(legend.position = "right") # the default
base + theme(legend.position = "left")
base + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3))
base + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3))
```
plot short + wide = legend on top / bottom
tall + narrow = left / right
legend.position = "none" = suppress legend display
To control individual legend display, use guides() + guide_legend() or guide_colourbar()
Example shows 2 important settings: controlling number of rows in legend (nrow) + overriding one of the aesthetics to make point bigger - useful if have low alpha to display many points on plot:
```{r NROW AND AESTHETIC OVERRIDE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2, override.aes = list(size = 4)))
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
```
name of argument in guides() matches aesthetic name like in labs()

## Replacing a Scale
Can replace scale completely rather than tweaking scale
2 types of scale most likely wanting switching out:
```
1. continuous position scales
2. colour scales
```

Same principles apply to all other aesthetics 
useful to plot transformations of variable eg) easier to see precise relationship between carat and price if log transform them:
```{r VARIABLE TRANSFORMATION PLOT}
# Left
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_bin2d()

# Right
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = log10(carat), y = log10(price))) +
  geom_bin2d()
```
Disadvanatge = axes now labelles w transformed values - hard to interpret plot
instead of transforming in aesthetic mapping, can do in scale instead - visually identical BUT axes labelled on OG data scale :
```{r SCALE TRANSFORMATION}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_bin2d() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10()
```
Colour also frequently customised
default categorical scale picks colours that are evenly spaced around colour wheel
useful alts = ColorBrewer scales - tweaked to work better for people with common cololour blindness
following 2 plots look similar BUT enough difference in shades of red and green that dots on right can be distinguishedby people with red-green colourblindness
```{r COLOURBLINDNESS }
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```
If just a few colours, can add redundant shape mapping - helps ensure plot is interpretable in black and white:
```{r REDUNDANT SHAPE MAPPING}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv, shape = drv)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```
When have predefined mapping between values and colours - scale_colour_manual()
eg) map presidential party to colour - want to use standard mapping of red = Republican, blue = Democrat - one approach = assigning colurs via hex colour codes:
```{r HEX COLOUR CODES}
presidential |>
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = start, y = id, color = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "#E81B23", Democratic = "#00AEF3"))
```
Continuous colour - built-in scale_colour_gradient() OR scale_fill_gradient()
if diverging scale, scale_colour_gradient2()- allows you to give eg) positive and negative values different colours - useful if want to distinguish points above or below mean

Another option = viridis colour scales- perceptible to people with colourblindness as well as perceptually uniform in both colour and black/white
available as continuous (c), discrete(d) and binned(b) palettes in ggplot2
```{r VIRIDIS}
df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = rnorm(10000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(title = "Default, continuous", x = NULL, y = NULL)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Viridis, continuous", x = NULL, y = NULL)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_viridis_b() +
  labs(title = "Viridis, binned", x = NULL, y = NULL)

```
colour scales come in 2 varieties = scale_colour_*() + scale_fill_*() for colour and fill aesthetics separately

## Zooming 
3 ways to control plot limits:
```
1. Adjusting what data is plotted
2. Setting limits for each scale
3. setting xlim and ylim in coord_cartesian
```

Left plot = relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency coloured by drv
right = same variables BUT subsets of data plotted - affects x and y scales + smooth curve:
```{r SUBSETTING}
# Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth()

# Right
mpg |>
  filter(displ >= 5 & displ <= 6 & hwy >= 10 & hwy <= 25) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth()
```
Setting limits on individual scales generally more useful when wanting to expand limits
eg) to match scales across different plots
Example = extract 2 car classes and plot separately, hard to compare plots as all 3 scales (x, y and colour) have different ranges
```{r CAR CLASS COMPARISON}
suv <- mpg |> filter(class == "suv")
compact <- mpg |> filter(class == "compact")

# SUV
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point()

# Compact
ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point()
```
Overcome by sharing scales across multiple plots - training scales with limits of full data:
```{r CAR CLASS COMPARISON VIA SCALE SHARING}
x_scale <- scale_x_continuous(limits = range(mpg$displ))
y_scale <- scale_y_continuous(limits = range(mpg$hwy))
col_scale <- scale_color_discrete(limits = unique(mpg$drv))

# SUV
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale

# Compact
ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale
```
Could have faceted BUT this technique more useful generally ie) spread plots across multiple pages of report

## Exercises
1. Why doesn’t the following code override the default scale?
```{r 1}
df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = rnorm(10000)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +
  coord_fixed()

#Corrected
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") +  # Use fill instead of color
  coord_fixed()

```
geom_hex uses fill aesthetic for colouring not colour for the hexagons

2.What is the first argument to every scale? How does it compare to labs()?

Usually aesthetic argument
scale functions controls mapping of variables to aesthetics and appearance of aesthetics - used to modify how data is represented visually
labs used for adding or modifying axis labels, legends, titles - doesnt control data appearance

3. Change the display of the presidential terms by:

    a)Combining the two variants that customize colors and x axis breaks.
    b)Improving the display of the y axis.
    c)Labelling each term with the name of the president.
    d)Adding informative plot labels.
    e)Placing breaks every 4 years (this is trickier than it seems!).

```{r 3a}
presidential_duration <- presidential |> 
  mutate(
    term_duration = as.numeric(end - start)
  )

ggplot(presidential_duration, aes(x = name, y = term_duration, colour = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(name = NULL) + # Use scale_x_discrete for categorical data
   scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "#E81B23", Democratic = "#00AEF3")) 
 
  
  
```
```{r 3b}
presidential_duration <- presidential |> 
  mutate(
    term_duration_years = as.numeric(end - start) / 365.25  # Convert duration to years
  )

ggplot(presidential_duration, aes(x = name, y = term_duration_years, colour = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(name = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = label_number(scale = 1, accuracy = 1)
  ) +
  labs(y = "Term Duration (Years)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "#E81B23", Democratic = "#00AEF3"))

  
```
```{r 3c}

4. First, create the following plot. Then, modify the code using override.aes to make the legend easier to see
```{r 4}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1, override.aes = list(size = 4))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Fair" = "green", "Very Good" = "blue", "Ideal" = "red", "Good" = "pink", "Premium" = "purple"))
```

### Themes
Can customise non-data elements of plot with theme:
```{r THEMES}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```
Can control individual components of each theme eg) size and colour of font used
Can chnage direction of legend + put in black border around it
legend box customisation and plot title elements of theme done with element_*() - specify styling of non-data components e.g., the title text is bolded in the face argument of element_text() and the legend border color is defined in the color argument of element_rect().
Theme elements controlling title / caption position = plot.title.position + plot.caption.position
in following plot, set to "plot" - indicates these elements are aligned to entire plot area instead of plot panel(default)
```{r PLOT.TITLE/CAPTION.POSITION}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy",
    caption = "Source: https://fueleconomy.gov."
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.6, 0.7),
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "black"),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)
  )

```

## Exercises
1. Pick a theme offered by the ggthemes package and apply it to the last plot you made.
```{r 1}
ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale +
  theme_bw()
```
2. Make the axis labels of your plot blue and bolded
```{r 2}
ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(color = "blue", face = "bold"),  
    axis.title.y = element_text(color = "blue", face = "bold")   
  )
  
```
